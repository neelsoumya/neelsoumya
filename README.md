### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Soumya Banerjee (first name pronounced as show-mo) and I am a senior research fellow at the University of Cambridge.

I analyze complex problems and implement new statistical and machine learning techniques for deriving insights from large amounts of data.

I work at the intersection of complex systems and explainable Artificial Intelligence.


I have worked in the experimental sciences, clinical, financial and healthcare domains. I have also worked in industry and was domain certified in finance and mortgage.
